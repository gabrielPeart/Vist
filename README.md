##Setting up the project
All the LLVM files are configured in the repo, all you need to do is pull from it on your machine.

You can get LLVM yourself by `cd /path-to-target-dir/` then `svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk llvm`, and you can parse it using [CMake](http://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html).
